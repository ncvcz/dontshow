# Don't Show

**Don't Show** is a privacy-first Chrome and Firefox extension that lets you **hide sensitive content from any website**, using custom rules.

> Ideal for screen recordings, livestreams, or just decluttering your workspace.

## ✨ What it does

- **Hide elements by text** – Instantly hide any element containing specific keywords (e.g. “Balance”, “Email”, “€”).
- **Regex power** – Use advanced patterns to match dynamic or partial content.
- **Toggle in one click** – Instantly enable/disable the extension when needed.
- **Fast & local** – Everything runs in your browser. No server involved.

## 🔒 Built with privacy in mind

- No tracking
- No data collection
- No analytics
- No remote storage

Your rules are stored locally and processed entirely in the browser.

## 💡 Use cases

- Blur personal info during live calls
- Hide client data when screen sharing
- Clean up pages for clean screenshots
- Mask distracting or irrelevant content

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dontshow.git
